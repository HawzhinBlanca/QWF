# QwantumWaveform

A quantum waveform visualization application that demonstrates quantum phenomena with interactive 2D and 3D visualizations.

## Recent Optimizations

### Quantum Simulator
- Added LRU cache with size limits (100 entries) to prevent memory growth
- Implemented SIMD acceleration for complex number calculations
- Optimized probability density calculations with Accelerate framework
- Added proper cache invalidation when parameters change

- Added buffer pooling for uniform and vertex buffers
- Reduced debug logging with conditional logging system
- Optimized shader uniforms to minimize state changes
- Added proper cleanup in deinit to prevent memory leaks
- Improved error handling with consolidated try-catch blocks
- Pre-allocated vertex arrays for mesh generation to reduce GC pressure

### Thread Safety
- Added atomic property wrappers for thread-safe operations
- Replaced heavy queue synchronization with lighter atomic operations 
- Fixed potential race conditions in renderer updates
- Improved concurrency with proper weak self references

### Data Structure Optimization
- Added visualization data caching to avoid redundant calculations
- Added conditional updates based on parameter changes
- Implemented lazy initialization for expensive resources
- Added parameter change detection to skip unnecessary updates
- Improved mesh creation by reusing vertex data structures

### Memory Management
- Optimized memory usage with buffer reuse strategies
- Reduced CPU/GPU synchronization points
- Improved weak reference handling throughout the codebase
